## The challenge

Create a Full Stack Web Application with the following features:

- [x] Use a Node and Express web server
- [x] Backed by a MySQL database with a Sequelize ORM
- [x] Use an existing public dataset to power the database (Kaggel 7K Books)
- [x] Migration strategy using seeds and schema files
- [x] Routes for retrieving and adding new data
- [x] Incorporate authentication (Passport, BCrypt)
- [x] Folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm
- [x] Use Handlebars for server-side templating
- [x] Protected API keys in Node with environment variables
- [x] Polished front end/UI
- [x] Meet good-quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming, etc.)
- [x] Deployed using Heroku (with data)

## The development process

In order to accomplish the challenge, the following steps were done:

1. Brain storming to define the project main concept.
2. External datasets research.
3. Define the purpose, and concept of the application.
4. Define the team members roles.
5. Define MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) and due dates.
6. Create sketches.
7. Define the routes, requests and responses structure.
8. Front end and back end coding.
9. Integrate full stack application.
10. Final review and proper documentation.

## The Output

With the described process we were able to create an angaging, useful and efficient full stack web application.

**User stories**

1. As a user I want to navigate through categories, and select a book, so I can read detail information about it
2. As a user I want to select books, add them to a purchasing cart, review information and confirm purchase, so I will receive a confirmation of my operation.
3. As a user I want to pass through an authentication process, so that I can feel confident that the site is secure and keep the record of my operations.
